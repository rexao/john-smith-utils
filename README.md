# John Smith Utils

This is a collection of miscellaneous utils. No concrete development plans.

## Summary

### Emote Sync Utils

`array_sync.py` `guild_sync.py`

The scripts download emotes from BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ and 7TV and sync to Discord servers.
**Array Sync** syncs to an array of servers such that with Nitro privilleges in mind you can use the Twitch emotes everywhere.
**Guild Sync** syncs to a specific server and makes them (the static ones ðŸ˜Ÿ) available for everyone.

## Setup

#### 1. Set up the server array

For Array Sync, it's required to setup an array of server first. Create as many servers as it's needed to accomodate the emotes (like ~10 of them). It's recommended to put them into a folder and place the folder on top so that the emotes in the array show up as the default (as opposed to e.g. `:Pog~1:`).

#### 2. Configure `config.json`

`"twitch_uid"` : Twitch user ID. Tools that convert Twitch user names into UID are available online.
`"stv_uid"` : 7TV user ID. The ID can be found in the URL of an 7TV user page.
`"js_token"` : Discord bot token.
`"labo_array"` : Key in the server IDs. (Only required for Array Sync)
